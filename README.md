# Traffic-Sign-Classifier

Build a Traffic Sign Recognition Project

The goals / steps of this project are the following:

* Load the data set (see below for links to the project data set)
* Explore, summarize and visualize the data set
* Design, train and test a model architecture
* Use the model to make predictions on new images
* Analyze the softmax probabilities of the new images
* Summarize the results with a written report


Data Set Summary & Exploration

1. Provide a basic summary of the data set. In the code, the analysis should be done using python, numpy and/or pandas methods rather than hardcoding results manually.

I used the pandas library to calculate summary statistics of the traffic signs data set:

* The size of training set is ?

* The size of the validation set is ?

* The size of test set is ?

* The shape of a traffic sign image is ?

* The number of unique classes/labels in the data set is ?
